chore: enable TreatWarningsAsErrors to prevent future warnings

This ensures that any new warnings introduced in the future will
immediately break the build, preventing warning accumulation and
maintaining code quality standards.

- Added TreatWarningsAsErrors=true to main project
- Added TreatWarningsAsErrors=true to test project
- Verified build still succeeds with 0 warnings
